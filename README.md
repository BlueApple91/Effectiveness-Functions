The matlab files of the effectiveness functions for J3, G4 and H4 STHEs, which are divided - flow shell and tube heat exchangers.
J3 STHE = J type Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger with three tube-passes
G4 STHE = G type Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger with four tube-passes with overall counter-flow pattern
H4 STHE = H type Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger with four tube-passes with overall counter-flow pattern

Effectiveness = Func(Ct,Cs,UA)

Ct = Tube-side fluid heat capacity, W/°C
Cs = Shell-side fluid heat capacity, W/°C
UA = Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient  x Heat Transfer Area, W/°C
